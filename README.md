# Human-Detection-in-Thermal-Images-Using-YOLOv7-
This project focuses on detecting humans in thermal infrared images using the YOLOv7 object detection model. It was developed as part of my internship, aiming to build a fast and accurate detection system suitable for low-visibility environments such as night surveillance, disaster zones, and industrial safety monitoring.

The model was trained on a curated dataset of thermal images where human subjects were annotated for bounding box detection. YOLOv7â€™s real-time performance and high detection precision make it well-suited for thermal vision tasks, where edge clarity and contrast are often poor.

ðŸ§ª Internship Project â€“ This work was carried out under the guidance of [Organization/Institution Name] to explore deep learning applications in thermal imaging.
